# 📏 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor with LEDs (HC-SR04 + Arduino)

This project uses an **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** to measure distance and turns on LEDs based on how close an object is to the sensor. It’s a great beginner project to understand distance sensing and conditional control using Arduino.

## 📌 Features

- Measures distance using HC-SR04
- Controls 3 LEDs based on distance thresholds
- Real-time feedback for object proximity
- Easy to build and understand

## 🧰 Hardware Required

- Arduino Uno (or compatible)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor
- 3x LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 3x 220Ω resistors
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## 🔌 Pin Configuration

| Component    | Arduino Pin |
|--------------|-------------|
| HC-SR04 TRIG | 9           |
| HC-SR04 ECHO | 10          |
| Red LED      | 3           |
| Yellow LED   | 4           |
| Green LED    | 5           |
